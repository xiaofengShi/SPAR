We choose these three characteristics for their significance in open-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream models. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model generalization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution generalization, and complexity to be beneficial for both.

To address the safety issues in autonomous driving systems, a recent set of testing techniques have been designed to automatically generate artificial driving scenes to enrich test suite, e.g., generating new input images transformed from the original ones. However, these techniques are insufficient due to two limitations: first, many such synthetic images often lack diversity of driving scenes, and hence compromise the resulting efficacy and reliability. Second, for machine-learning-based systems, a mismatch between training and application domain can dramatically degrade system accuracy, such that it is necessary to validate inputs for improving system robustness. In this paper, we propose DeepRoad, an unsupervised DNN-based framework for automatically testing the consistency of DNN-based autonomous driving systems and online validation. First, DeepRoad automatically synthesizes large amounts of diverse driving scenes without using image transformation rules (e.g. scale, shear and rotation). In particular, DeepRoad is able to produce driving scenes with various weather conditions (including those with rather extreme conditions) by applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with the corresponding real-world weather scenes. Second, DeepRoad utilizes metamorphic testing techniques to check the consistency of such systems using synthetic images. Third, DeepRoad validates input images for DNN-based systems by measuring the distance of the input and training images using their VGGNet features.

ERA5 dataset was also used for finetuning as well performance analysis in the validation dataset. Three different setups (CMIP6; CMIP6 + elevation; CMIP6 + elevation + ERA5 finetuning) were used with both UNet and UNet++ algorithms resulting in six different models.

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) analysis revealed that UNet++ with CMIP6 with elevation and ERA5 finetuning model with \"Year 3 Month 2\" temporal case provided the best outcome with an MAE of 0.7. Regression analysis over the validation dataset between the ERA5 data values and the corresponding AI model predictions revealed slope and $R^2$ values close to 1 suggesting a very good agreement.

Such assumptions falter in the inherently uncertain, incomplete, and dynamic contexts of the open world. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements designed to adapt FSL for use in open-world settings. We categorize existing methods into three distinct types of open-world few-shot learning: those involving varying instances, varying classes, and varying distributions. Each category is discussed in terms of its specific challenges and methods, as well as its strengths and weaknesses. We standardize experimental settings and metric benchmarks across scenarios, and provide a comparative analysis of the performance of various methods.

Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches.

Recent studies have made tremendous efforts towards audio-visual or audio-semantic modeling to enhance performance.

First, we build insights into the visual connections among active speakers and the semantic interactions within spoken content, thereby establishing abundant pairwise constraints.

In this paper, we leverage language understanding capabilities and adapt large language models (LLMs) as an environment (LE) to enhance RL-based recommenders. The LE is learned from a subset of user-item interaction data, thus reducing the need for large training data, and can synthesise user feedback for offline data by: (i) acting as a state model that produces high quality states that enrich the user representation, and (ii) functioning as a reward model to accurately capture nuanced user preferences on actions.

Most existing offline RL recommender systems focus on model-based RL through learning a world model from offline data and building the recommendation policy by interacting with this model. Although these methods have made progress in the recommendation performance, the effectiveness of model-based offline RL methods is often constrained by the accuracy of the estimation of the reward model and the model uncertainties, primarily due to the extreme discrepancy between offline logged data and real-world data in user interactions with online platforms. To fill this gap, a more accurate reward model and uncertainty estimation are needed for the model-based RL methods.

They help us find our favorite items to purchase, our friends on social networks, and our favorite movies to watch. Traditionally, the recommendation problem was considered to be a classification or prediction problem, but it is now widely agreed that formulating it as a sequential decision problem can better reflect the user-system interaction. Therefore, it can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and be solved by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, RL is able to handle the sequential, dynamic user-system interaction and to take into account the long-term user engagement. Although the idea of using RL for recommendation is not new and has been around for about two decades, it was not very practical, mainly because of scalability problems of traditional RL algorithms. However, a new trend has emerged in the field since the introduction of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which made it possible to apply RL to the recommendation problem with large state and action spaces. In this paper, a survey on reinforcement learning based recommender systems (RLRSs) is presented. Our aim is to present an outlook on the field and to provide the reader with a fairly complete knowledge of key concepts of the field.

Additionally, DRL models lack transparency, making it difficult to guarantee safety in all scenarios, particularly those not seen during training.

Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on data from computationally expensive short, high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features.

The duration of blocking events is, however, underestimated in climate models. Explainable Artificial Intelligence are a class of data analysis methods that can help identify physical causes of prolonged blocking events and diagnose model deficiencies. We demonstrate this approach on an idealized quasigeostrophic model developed by Marshall and Molteni (1993). We train a convolutional neural network (CNN), and subsequently, build a sparse predictive model for the persistence of Atlantic blocking, conditioned on an initial high-pressure anomaly. Shapley Additive ExPlanation (SHAP) analysis reveals that high-pressure anomalies in the American Southeast and North Atlantic, separated by a trough over Atlantic Canada, contribute significantly to prediction of sustained blocking events in the Atlantic region. This agrees with previous work that identified precursors in the same regions via wave train analysis. When we apply the same CNN to blockings in the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis, there is insufficient data to accurately predict persistent blocks. We partially overcome this limitation by pre-training the CNN on the plentiful data of the Marshall-Molteni model, and then using Transfer Learning to achieve better predictions than direct training. SHAP analysis before and after transfer learning allows a comparison between the predictive features in the reanalysis and the quasigeostrophic model, quantifying dynamical biases in the idealized model.

This paper explores the zero-shot abilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of literature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two components: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing a literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective LLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step search strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the abstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying an external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking mechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized recall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the LLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step approach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in the plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based literature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a protocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set contamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to promote additional research and development in this regard.

Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these methods leads to fundamental scaling issues at thousands of GPUs, e.g., due to expensive cross-node communication or devices spending significant time waiting on other devices to make progress.

Here we show that, for crucial case estimating expectation values observables (key almost all NISQ algorithms) one can indeed achieve an effective exponential suppression. We take n independently prepared circuit outputs create state whose symmetries prevent from contributing bias expected value. The approach very well suited current near-term devices as it modular main computation requires only shallow that bridges copies immediately prior measurement. Using no more than four copies, confirm suppression below 10−6 circuits consisting several hundred noisy gates (2-qubit gate 0.5%) numerical simulations validating our approach.5 MoreReceived 1 February 2021Revised 3 June 2021Accepted 30 July 2021DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.11.031057Published by American Physical Society under terms Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The crux of our design is a fast hardware decoder that can approximately decode detected error syndromes rapidly. Specifically, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept that approximate error decoding can be accomplished online in near-term quantum systems by designing and implementing a novel algorithm in Single-Flux Quantum (SFQ) superconducting logic technology. This avoids a critical decoding backlog, hidden in all offline decoding schemes, that leads to idle time exponential in the number of T gates in a program.   Our design utilizes one SFQ processing module per physical qubit. Employing state-of-the-art SFQ synthesis tools, we show that the circuit area, power, and latency are within the constraints of contemporary quantum system designs.

In this paper, we first highlight two novel properties of robust features from the feature distribution perspective: 1) \\textbf{Diversity}.

Among the existing techniques, self-training methods have undoubtedly attracted greater attention in recent years. These models are designed to find the decision boundary on low density regions without making additional assumptions about the data distribution, and use the unsigned output score of a learned classifier, or its margin, as an indicator of confidence. The working principle of self-training algorithms is to learn a classifier iteratively by assigning pseudo-labels to the set of unlabeled training samples with a margin greater than a certain threshold. The pseudo-labeled examples are then used to enrich the labeled training data and to train a new classifier in conjunction with the labeled training set.

Therefore, the label guidance on labeled data is hard to be propagated to unlabeled data. Consequently, the learning process on labeled data is much faster than on unlabeled data which is likely to fall into a local minima that does not favor unlabeled data, leading to sub-optimal generalization performance. In this paper, we propose FlatMatch which minimizes a cross-sharpness measure to ensure consistent learning performance between the two datasets. Specifically, we increase the empirical risk on labeled data to obtain a worst-case model which is a failure case that needs to be enhanced. Then, by leveraging the richness of unlabeled data, we penalize the prediction difference (i.e., cross-sharpness) between the worst-case model and the original model so that the learning direction is beneficial to generalization on unlabeled data. Therefore, we can calibrate the learning process without being limited to insufficient label information.

Towards Context and Semantic Infused Dialogue Generation Loss Function and Evaluation Metric", "abstract": "Over the past two decades, dialogue modeling has made significant strides, moving from simple rule-based responses to personalized and persuasive response generation. However, despite these advancements, the objective functions and evaluation metrics for dialogue generation have remained stagnant. These lexical-based metrics, e.g., cross-entropy and BLEU, have two key limitations: (a) word-to-word matching without semantic consideration: It assigns the same credit for failure to generate \"nice\" and \"rice\" for \"good\", (b) missing context attribute for evaluating the generated response: Even if a generated response is relevant to the ongoing dialogue context, it may still be penalized for not matching the gold utterance provided in the corpus. In this paper, we first investigate these limitations comprehensively and propose a new loss function called Semantic Infused Contextualized diaLogue (SemTextualLogue) loss function. We also formulate an evaluation metric called Dialuation, incorporating both context and semantic relevance. We experimented with both non-pretrained and pre-trained models on two dialogue corpora, encompassing task-oriented and open-domain scenarios. We found that the dialogue generation models trained with SemTextualLogueloss attained superior performance compared to the traditional cross-entropy loss function. The findings establish that the effective training of a dialogue generation model hinges significantly on incorporating semantics and context. This pattern is also mirrored in the introduced Dialuation metric, where the consideration of both context and semantics correlates more strongly with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics.", "author": ["Abhisek Tiwari", "Muhammed Sinan", "Kaushik Roy", "Amit Sheth", "Sriparna Saha", "Pushpak Bhattacharyya"], "year": "20230911", "source": ["Google"], "sim_score_sml": 0.7, "sim_score_llm": 0.85}, {"paperID": "1906.00500", "title": "A Survey of Natural Language Generation Techniques with a Focus on Dialogue Systems - Past, Present and Future Directions", "abstract": "One of the hardest problems in the area of Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence is automatically generating language that is coherent and understandable to humans.

Natural language generation (NLG) is a critical component of spoken dialogue and it has a significant impact both on usability and perceived quality.

They are also not easily scaled to systems covering multiple domains and languages. This paper presents a statistical language generator based on a semantically controlled Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) structure. The LSTM generator can learn from unaligned data by jointly optimising sentence planning and surface realisation using a simple cross entropy training criterion, and language variation can be easily achieved by sampling from output candidates.

We analyzed six classifiers Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Trees, and Deep Neural Networks using two feature extraction methods: bag-of-words and TF-IDF. The primary objective was to determine the most effective classifier-feature combination for SMS spam detection. Our research offers two main contributions: first, by systematically examining various classifier and feature extraction pairings, and second, by empirically evaluating their ability to distinguish spam messages. Our results demonstrate that the TF-IDF method consistently outperforms the bag-of-words approach across all six classifiers. Specifically, Naive Bayes with TF-IDF achieved the highest accuracy of 96.2%, with a precision of 0.976 for non-spam and 0.754 for spam messages. Similarly, Support Vector Machines with TF-IDF exhibited an accuracy of 94.5%, with a precision of 0.926 for non-spam and 0.891 for spam. Deep Neural Networks using TF-IDF yielded an accuracy of 91.0%, with a recall of 0.991 for non-spam and 0.415 for spam messages. In contrast, classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Decision Trees showed weaker performance, regardless of the feature extraction method employed. Furthermore, we observed substantial variability in classifier effectiveness depending on the chosen feature extraction technique.

However, conventional FL methods typically necessitate multiple communication rounds, leading to significant communication overhead and delays, especially in environments with limited bandwidth. One-shot federated learning addresses these issues by conducting model training and aggregation in a single communication round, thereby reducing communication costs while preserving privacy. Among these, one-shot federated ensemble learning combines independently trained client models using ensemble techniques such as voting, further boosting performance in non-IID data scenarios. On the other hand, existing machine learning methods in healthcare predominantly use unimodal data (e.g., medical images or textual reports), which restricts their diagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness.

Second, they do not fully leverage multiple health records from diverse modalities to learn robust complementary information. And finally, they typically rely on a single attention mechanism, missing the benefits of multiple attention strategies within and across various modalities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dual robust information fusion attention mechanism (DRIFA) that leverages two attention modules, i.e. multi-branch fusion attention module and the multimodal information fusion attention module. DRIFA can be integrated with any deep neural network, forming a multimodal fusion learning framework denoted as DRIFA-Net. We show that the multi-branch fusion attention of DRIFA learns enhanced representations for each modality, such as dermoscopy, pap smear, MRI, and CT-scan, whereas multimodal information fusion attention module learns more refined multimodal shared representations, improving the network's generalization across multiple tasks and enhancing overall performance.

Existing lung cancer diagnostic techniques face the challenges of high cost and slow diagnosis. Early and rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve the outcome of lung cancer. In this study, a deep learning-based multi-modal spectral information fusion (MSIF) network is proposed for lung adenocarcinoma cell detection. First, multi-modal data of Fourier transform infrared spectra, UV-vis absorbance spectra, and fluorescence spectra of normal and patient cells were collected. Subsequently, the spectral text data were efficiently processed by one-dimensional convolutional neural network. The global and local features of the spectral images are deeply mined by the hybrid model of ResNet and Transformer. An adaptive depth-wise convolution (ADConv) is introduced to be applied to feature extraction, overcoming the shortcomings of conventional convolution. In order to achieve feature learning between multi-modalities, a cross-modal interaction fusion (CMIF) module is designed. This module fuses the extracted spectral image and text features in a multi-faceted interaction, enabling full utilization of multi-modal features through feature sharing. The method demonstrated excellent performance on the test sets of Fourier transform infrared spectra, UV-vis absorbance spectra and fluorescence spectra, achieving 95.83 %, 97.92 % and 100 % accuracy, respectively. In addition, experiments validate the superiority of multi-modal spectral data and the robustness of the model generalization capability.

As a less invasive alternative to the standard diagnostic practice of endomyocardial biopsy, which is highly invasive and thus limited to severe cases, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging offers a promising solution for detecting myocardial abnormalities.<i>Approach.</i>This study introduces a deep model called ELRL-MD that combines ensemble learning and reinforcement learning (RL) for effective myocarditis diagnosis from CMR images. The model begins with pre-training via the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to enhance the starting point for learning. An array of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) then works in concert to extract and integrate features from CMR images for accurate diagnosis. Leveraging the Z-Alizadeh Sani myocarditis CMR dataset, the model employs RL to navigate the dataset's imbalance by conceptualizing diagnosis as a decision-making process.<i>Main results.</i>ELRL-DM demonstrates remarkable efficacy, surpassing other deep learning, conventional machine learning, and transfer learning models, achieving an F-measure of 88.2% and a geometric mean of 90.6%. Extensive experimentation helped pinpoint the optimal reward function settings and the perfect count of CNNs.<i>Significance.</i>The study addresses the primary technical challenge of inherent data imbalance in CMR imaging datasets and the risk of models converging on local optima due to suboptimal initial weight settings.

This growing challenge highlights the necessity of developing efficient training methods for LVMs. Progressive learning, a training strategy in which model capacity gradually increases during training, has shown potential in addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present an advanced automated progressive learning (AutoProg) framework for efficient training of LVMs. We begin by focusing on the pre-training of LVMs, using ViTs as a case study, and propose AutoProg-One, an AutoProg scheme featuring momentum growth (MoGrow) and a one-shot growth schedule search. Beyond pre-training, we extend our approach to tackle transfer learning and fine-tuning of LVMs. We expand the scope of AutoProg to cover a wider range of LVMs, including diffusion models. First, we introduce AutoProg-Zero, by enhancing the AutoProg framework with a novel zero-shot unfreezing schedule search, eliminating the need for one-shot supernet training. Second, we introduce a novel Unique Stage Identifier (SID) scheme to bridge the gap during network growth. These innovations, integrated with the core principles of AutoProg, offer a comprehensive solution for efficient training across various LVM scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AutoProg accelerates ViT pre-training by up to 1.85x on ImageNet and accelerates fine-tuning of diffusion models by up to 2.86x, with comparable or even higher performance.

However, these techniques face the challenge of balancing semantic fidelity with diversity. Specifically, image mixing involves interpolating two images to create a new one, but this pixel-level interpolation can compromise fidelity. Generative augmentation uses text-to-image generative models to synthesize or modify images, often limiting diversity to avoid generating out-of-distribution data that potentially affects accuracy. We propose that this fidelity-diversity dilemma partially stems from the whole-image paradigm of existing methods. Since an image comprises the class-dependent part (CDP) and the class-independent part (CIP), where each part has fundamentally different impacts on the image's fidelity, treating different parts uniformly can therefore be misleading. To address this fidelity-diversity dilemma, we introduce Decoupled Data Augmentation (De-DA), which resolves the dilemma by separating images into CDPs and CIPs and handling them adaptively. To maintain fidelity, we use generative models to modify real CDPs under controlled conditions, preserving semantic consistency. To enhance diversity, we replace the image's CIP with inter-class variants, creating diverse CDP-CIP combinations.

Although traditional machine learning algorithms have been valuable, they exhibit limitations in handling complex sample data. The recent emergence of deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, driving substantial advancements in this field. This review focuses on recent progress in deep learning for pulmonary nodule detection, segmentation, and classification. Traditional machine learning methods, such as SVM and KNN, have shown limitations, paving the way for advanced approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

In the paper, the authors present the latest data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment and molecular aspects of this cancer. In the last decade, many molecular alterations that are effective in the development of lung cancer have been discovered.

However, the clinical translation of these therapeutics for the treatment of NSCLC faces challenges in delivery due to their immunogenicity, negative charge, and large size, which can be mitigated with delivery platforms. In this review, we provide a description of the pathophysiology of NSCLC and an overview of RNA-based therapeutics, specifically highlighting their potential application in the treatment of NSCLC. We discuss relevant classes of RNA and their therapeutic potential for NSCLC. We then discuss challenges in delivery and non-viral delivery strategies such as lipid- and polymer-based nanoparticles that have been developed to address these issues in preclinical models.

However, challenges remain in dealing with non-IID (independent and identically distributed) data, which is common in real-world scenarios. In this research, we used a client-server-based federated learning framework for brain tumor detection using MRI images, leveraging VGG19 as the backbone model. To improve clinical relevance and model interpretability, we have included explainability techniques, particularly Grad-CAM. We trained our model across four clients with non-IID data distribution to simulate real-world conditions. For performance evaluation, we used a centralized test dataset, consisting of 20% of the original data, with the test set used collectively for evaluating model performance after completing federated learning rounds. Using a separate test dataset ensures that all models are evaluated on the same data, making comparisons fair. Since the test dataset is not part of the FL training process, it does not violate the privacy-preserving nature of FL. The experimental results demonstrate that the VGG19 model achieves a high test accuracy of 97.18% (FedAVG), 98.24% (FedProx), and 98.45% (Scaffold) than other state-of-the-art models, showcasing the effectiveness of federated learning in handling distributed and non-IID data.

This study conveys the Bangladesh Brain Cancer MRI Dataset, containing 6,056 MRI images organized into three categories: Brain Tumor, Brain Glioma, and Brain Menin. The dataset was collected from several hospitals in Bangladesh, providing a diverse and realistic sample for research. We implemented advanced deep learning models, and DenseNet169 achieved exceptional results, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score all reaching 0.9983. In addition, Explainable AI (XAI) methods including GradCAM, GradCAM++, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM were employed to provide visual representations of the decision-making processes of the models. In the context of brain cancer, these techniques highlight DenseNet169's potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy while simultaneously offering transparency, facilitating early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.", "author": ["Md.

To put these figures in perspective, 64% of these cases are diagnosed early in the disease's cycle, giving patients a 99% chance of survival. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been used effectively in detection and treatment of several dangerous diseases, helping in early diagnosis and treatment, and thus increasing the patient's chance of survival. Deep learning has been designed to analyze the most important features affecting detection and treatment of serious diseases. For example, breast cancer can be detected using genes or histopathological imaging. Analysis at the genetic level is very expensive, so histopathological imaging is the most common approach used to detect breast cancer.

New biotechnological advances in vaccinology allow for recent advances that provide only the nucleic acid building blocks of an antigen, eliminating many safety concerns. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these DNA and RNA vaccines have facilitated the development and deployment of vaccines at an unprecedented pace. This success was attributable at least in part to broader shifts in scientific research relative to prior epidemics; the genome of SARS-CoV-2 was available as early as January 2020, facilitating global efforts in the development of DNA and RNA vaccines within two weeks of the international community becoming aware of the new viral threat. Additionally, these technologies that were previously only theoretical are not only safe but also highly efficacious. Although historically a slow process, the rapid development of vaccines during the COVID-19 crisis reveals a major shift in vaccine technologies. Here, we provide historical context for the emergence of these paradigm-shifting vaccines. We describe several DNA and RNA vaccines and in terms of their efficacy, safety, and approval status.

The introduction of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs) has reshaped clinical guidelines in recent decades. However, the effects of combining these drug classes remain uncertain. This review evaluates the current evidence on combination therapies involving SGLT2is, GLP-1RAs, and nsMRAs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, thereby focusing on treatments that in type 2 diabetes have shown cardio-renal protection, while exploring future research directions. In type 2 diabetes, much of the evidence comes from post hoc analyses of trials that primarily examine the effects of single drugs compared with placebo. This limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy and safety of combination therapy. Nonetheless, observational studies indicate that combining SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs may offer superior cardiovascular and mortality benefits compared with monotherapy. Data on kidney outcomes remain limited, but SGLT2is appear particularly effective when kidney protection is the primary goal, regardless of concurrent treatment. The use of nsMRAs is still emerging, and studies investigating their combination with SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs are scarce. In type 1 diabetes, combination therapies have primarily focused on glucose control and safety, with several randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of combining treatments such as SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs with insulin. No current studies have estimated the effects on heart and kidneys. Ongoing and planned studies aim to fill critical gaps in our understanding of combination therapy for type 1 diabetes. These studies hold the promise of determining whether similar risk reductions, as observed in type 2 diabetes, can be achieved, offering hope for improved outcomes in this high-risk population.

Current approaches for AD diagnosis and treatment planning are based on radiological imaging and largely inaccessible for population-level screening due to prohibitive costs and limited availability. Recently, blood tests have shown promise in diagnosing AD and highlighting possible biomarkers that can be used as drug targets for AD management. Blood tests are significantly more accessible to disadvantaged populations, cost-effective, and minimally invasive. However, biomarker discovery in the context of AD diagnosis is complex as there exist important associations between various biomarkers.

This work advocates for an interpretable health model, suitable for detecting several diseases, motivated by the observation that speech-affecting disorders often have overlapping effects on speech signals. A framework is presented that first defines \"reference speech\" and then leverages this definition for disease detection. Reference speech is characterized through reference intervals, i.e., the typical values of clinically meaningful acoustic and linguistic features derived from a reference population. This novel approach in the field of speech as a biomarker is inspired by the use of reference intervals in clinical laboratory science. Deviations of new speakers from this reference model are quantified and used as input to detect Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The classification strategy explored is based on Neural Additive Models, a type of glass-box neural network, which enables interpretability.

Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily based on amyloid-beta and tau biomarkers, often identify the disease at late stages, highlighting the need for more sensitive and accessible early detection tools. This review explores emerging non-traditional biomarkers, including salivary, lipid, urinary, synaptic, blood-based, microRNA (miRNA), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and inflammatory markers, which provide deeper insights into AD pathophysiology. These biomarkers reflect key pathological processes such as neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, synaptic damage, lipid dysregulation, and genetic factors. Non-invasive biomarkers, such as those found in saliva and urine, present promising avenues for large-scale screening, while advanced blood-based markers like neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) offer precise monitoring of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, miRNAs and lipid biomarkers shed light on molecular alterations in neuronal health and signaling. Integrating these biomarkers with imaging techniques, proteomics, and genetic profiling enhances diagnostic accuracy and enables personalized treatment approaches. This shift toward multi-dimensional biomarker assessment not only improves early detection but also aids in tailoring therapeutic strategies to individual disease profiles.

The microbiota plays a significant role in the predisposition and development of immune diseases, as well as various inflammatory processes. Importantly, the proper colonization of the fetal digestive system is influenced by maternal microbiota, the method of pregnancy completion and the further formation of the microbiota. In the subsequent stages of a child's life, breastfeeding, diet and the use of antibiotics influence the state of eubiosis, which determines proper growth and development from the neonatal period to adulthood. The literature data suggest that there is evidence to confirm that the intestinal microbiota of the infant plays an important role in regulating the immune response associated with the development of allergic diseases. However, the identification of specific bacterial species in relation to specific types of reactions in allergic diseases is the basic problem. <b>Background</b>: The main aim of the review was to demonstrate the influence of the microbiota of the mother, fetus and newborn on the functioning of the immune system in the context of allergies and asthma. <b>Methods</b>: We reviewed and thoroughly analyzed the content of over 1000 articles and abstracts between the beginning of June and the end of August 2024. Over 150 articles were selected for the detailed study. <b>Results</b>: The selection was based on the PubMed National Library of Medicine search engine, using selected keywords: \"the impact of intestinal microbiota on the development of immune diseases and asthma\", \"intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases\", \"the impact of intrauterine microbiota on the development of asthma\", \"intrauterine microbiota and immune diseases\", \"intrauterine microbiota and atopic dermatitis\", \"intrauterine microbiota and food allergies\", \"maternal microbiota\", \"fetal microbiota\" and \"neonatal microbiota\". The above relationships constituted the main criteria for including articles in the analysis. <b>Conclusions</b>: In the present review, we showed a relationship between the proper maternal microbiota and the normal functioning of the fetal and neonatal immune system. The state of eubiosis with an adequate amount and diversity of microbiota is essential in preventing the development of immune and allergic diseases. The way the microbiota is shaped, resulting from the health-promoting behavior of pregnant women, the rational conduct of the medical staff and the proper performance of the diagnostic and therapeutic process, is necessary to maintain the health of the mother and the child. Therefore, an appropriate lifestyle, rational antibiotic therapy as well as the way of completing the pregnancy are indispensable in the prevention of the above conditions. At the same time, considering the intestinal microbiota of the newborn in relation to the genera and phyla of bacteria that have a potentially protective effect, it is worth noting that the use of suitable probiotics and prebiotics seems to contribute to the protective effect.", "author": "Dera Norbert, Kosińska-Kaczyńska Katarzyna, Żeber-Lubecka Natalia, Brawura-Biskupski-Samaha Robert, Massalska Diana, Szymusik Iwona, Dera Kacper, Ciebiera Michał", "score": "0.87", "source": ["PubMed"], "sim_score_sml": 0.7, "sim_score_llm": 0.85}, {"title": "Exploring effects of gut microbiota on tertiary lymphoid structure formation for tumor immunotherapy.", "paperID": "PMID:40124706", "abstract": "Anti-tumor immunity, including innate and adaptive immunity is critical in inhibiting tumorigenesis and development of tumor.

Excitingly, studies have shown the contribution of TLSs to the adaptive immune responses. However, it is unclear how TLSs to form and how to more effectively defense against tumor through TLS formation. Recent studies have shown that the inflammation plays a critical role in TLS formation.

Many therapeutic approaches aim to reactivate the expression of the fetal hemoglobin genes. To this end, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been used to genetically modify patients' hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo and reactivate fetal hemoglobin expression in their erythroid progeny. More than 70 patients with severe β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease have been treated with the Casgevy® therapy. Most have achieved a significant improvement of clinical phenotype, with high editing efficiency in hematopoietic cells associated with normal or near normal hemoglobin levels. While the long-term safety and efficacy of this powerful approach still need to be evaluated, new strategies are being developed to further improve therapeutic outcomes, reduce potential genotoxicity and lower the costs of therapy.", "author": "Brusson Megane, Miccio Annarita", "score": "0.87", "source": ["PubMed"], "sim_score_sml": 0.7, "sim_score_llm": 0.85}, {"title": "Gene therapy for β-thalassemia: current and future options.", "paperID": "PMID:39794177", "abstract": "Beta-thalassemia is a severe, hereditary blood disorder characterized by anemia, transfusion dependence, reduced life expectancy, and poor quality of life.
